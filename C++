C++ is known for its balance between low-level programming (such as memory management) and high-level abstractions, which makes it a powerful choice for developers who need control over system resources while benefiting from a structured and object-oriented approach. It remains a popular language in many domains and is continually evolving with each new standard (e.g., C++11, C++17, C++20) to improve productivity and safety.
